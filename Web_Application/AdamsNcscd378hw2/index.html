		<span style="font-family:New Times Roman"><p><center>
			The Shinkansen or how its known in english The Bullet Train. Is a high speed network of passenger trains in Japan originally used to connect distant regions in Japan to
		the interior and Tokyo. Since it's inception almost 50 years ago they have transported 10 billion people with 0 fatalities or injuries due to collisions or derailments. These trains can reach <span class="bg-primary p-1 rounded">top speeds anywhere from 
		150 mph to 200 mph</span> however in test runs they apperently reached <span class="bg-error p-1 rounded">speeds of 275 mph with a world record of 375 mph.</span> The Shinkansen trains are electric multiple units which means multiple train cars can assits in pushing the
		whole trian forward which helps with acceleration. The Bullet trains can either have wheels or be Maglev trains the comparments are air tight as to protect passengers from changes in air pressure when entering a tunnel 
		at high speeds.

		<p><center>
			The Shinkansen rail lines are actually entirley seperate from japans older traditional rail lines and are larger gauge of rail. The railways being seperate also means they dont have to wait for freight or traditional 
		trains in order to continue on their route. This allows for many timley trips offered to passengers who can expect their train on time and to arrive at their destination on time. There are no road crossings of the rails
		as well as laws prohibiting entering the rails. The rails also cut through obstacles by utilizing tunnels which means they don't have to go around objects. The Shinkansen also employs ATC (automatic train control) which
		eliminates the need for rail side signage and signals. All trains are controlled from a centralized traffic control unit meaning the trains are computerized.

		<h1><center>Maglev Trains</center></h1>
		<p><center>
				Maglev trains also known as magnetic levitation trains are a form of transportation that utilize two sets of magents. One set is used to push the train up and away from the track
			the other set of magnets is used to propell the train foward on a virtually frictionless track. Along certain routes primarily medium range between 200 and 400 miles the maglev train 
			is able to compete with highspeed rail as well as airplanes. Interestingly enough at speeds under 93 mph some trains have to be assisted by retractable wheels. Maglev trains have the potential 
			to be queiter and smoother than conventional trains as well as reach higher top speeds. The Shanghai maglev train is known to have a top speed of 270 mph which pushes the top speed over the top
			safe operation speed of bullet trains at around 200 mph.
		</center></p>

			Maglev trains can ride on a mono or dual rail but not all mono rail trains are maglev. In fact some trains have wheels for support and just use magnets for propulsion such trains are not considered maglev.
			The two main types of maglev technology are <span class="bg-warning p-1 rounded">EMS electromagnetic suspension</span> and <span class="bg-warning p-1 rounded">EDS Electrodynamic suspension</span>. With EMS the train has electronically controlled electromagnets and is attracted to the steel track. With EDS
			uses superconducting electromagnets or even strong permanent magents. The magnetic field it generates induces currents in nearby metallic conductors which pushes and pulls the train toward the designed 
			levitation position on the rail way.
