CSCD 378 HW 6

Instructions: 
First things first, open your terminal and navigate by changing your directory to the folder that was just extracted containing this file. 
Example: (cd c:/Users/user/Downloads/AdamsNcscd378hw6/CityNameDbApp) Next we need to rebuild the vendor file so from the command prompt type "composer install"
once that is finished the next step will be to type "php artisan serve" into the command prompt which will start the local web server. 
Now you can open a web brower I used microsoft edge and in the url type "http://127.0.0.1:8000/cities" this will display the cities from the database 
in a columnar format. Whenever you are done viewing in the command prompt type "Ctrl+c" to end the web server session.
